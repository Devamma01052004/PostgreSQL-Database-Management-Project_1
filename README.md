📊 PostgreSQL Database Analysis
📌 Project Overview

The PostgreSQL Database Analysis project focuses on performing data analysis using SQL queries in PostgreSQL. The project demonstrates practical usage of DBMS concepts, including joins, subqueries, aggregations, and data filtering to extract meaningful insights from structured data.

This project is designed to strengthen hands-on skills in SQL querying, relational database management, and analytical thinking.
